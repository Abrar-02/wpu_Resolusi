TODAY IS 20/01/2023 TIME = 18:36 PM
MY HOPE AT LEAST I CAN ADVANCE IN SQL $ EXCEL ON 25/02/2023
AND FOR THE NEXT STEP IM SO EXITED TO LEARN PHYTON (FOR DATA ANALYST, PANDAS, MATPLOTLIB, NUMPHY) & VISUALIAZATION TOOL (TABLEAU, POWER BI)
AND TO MAKE IT REAL THE FIRST STEP IS QUERY SQL, CAN USE STATEMENT (JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, COUNT, COALESCE, DISTINCT etc), OPERATOR (LIKE,OR,IN,TRIM,REGEXP,BINARY,etc), SYMBOLS & SUBQUERY
AND FOR PHYTON MIN UNDESTAND ABOUT HOW TO CONNECTING DATABASE TO PHYTON
FOR VISUALIZATION I NEED MORE LEARN ABOUT TABLEAU AND TO BE CREATIVE PERSON
